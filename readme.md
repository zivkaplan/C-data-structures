# 🧬 C Data Structures

## Usable implementations of common data structures written in C.

♾️ During [Infinity Labs](https://infinitylabs.co.il/) course I have learned to implement various data structures in C.

Here, I am uploading re-implementations for the sake of exercise.

Every DS has a folder with a header file, source file and a small test that demonstrate the API functionality, and a simple makefile.
Note that some DS will be built upon others.

### 🟢 Ready:

-   Stack
-   Singly Linked List
-   Queue (using singly linked list)
-   Doubly Linked List
-   Vector
-   Circular Queue (fixed sized queue using array)
-   AVL

### 🟡 In Progress:

-   Binary Search Tree

### 🟠 To Do (in the near future):

-   Add to each DS file with info (complexity, pros and cons)
