# 🧬 C Data Structures

## Usable implementations of common data structures written in C.

♾️ During [Infinity Labs](https://infinitylabs.co.il/) course I have learned to implement various data structures in C.

Here, I am uploading re-implementations for the sake of exercise.  

Every DS has a folder with a header file, source file and a small test that demonstrate the API functionality, and a simple makefile.
Note that some DS will be built upon others.   

### 🟢 Ready:
- Stack
- Singly Linked List
- Queue (using singly linked list)
- Doubly Linked List


### 🟡 In Progress:
- Vector


### 🟠 To Do (in the near future): 
- Circular Queue (fixed sized queue using array)
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL
- Add to each DS file with info (complexity, pros and cons)
